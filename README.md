### Sorting and Hashing
This project is meant to implement the algorithm merge sort in the index_build.py, which in this context used to sort the words appeared in the text file attached in the file. The main function implemented by myself is **createIndexFromEntries(entryfile, indexfile)**.

perfect_hashing.py is used to implement a hashing technique that would not cause clashes of hash values. The main functions I implemented is **addIndex(l)**, and **hashCompress(L, m)**.

And the final file search_queries.py is used to implement heap to improve the original algorithm. The main function I wrote is the class **HitStreamQ**.

The project is the assignment1 of the course inf-algorithms and data structures. The structure and materials are provided.
